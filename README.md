# maze

Welcome to my maze game!
My maze is called The Hungry Pink Dot.
It is based of the Webkinz game Hungry Hog. Its relates to that game becuase my "dot" represents the pig and the "coins" represent te candy.
So here's how you play
the pink square is the good guy in the game. It's job is to collect coins with out getting touched by the red player (the enemy). The coins are the green squares in the game. Some are the coins are traped were you can not reach them. These are hidden doors. You can get rid of the doors by passing the white squares. There are two ways you can end the game. The first way is by collecting all the coins and you win. Or if you get hit by the enemy it is game over. But it is easy to restart the game. All you have to do is hit the space bar and it will reset the game so you can play again. 
Hope you enjoy playing The Hungry Pink Dot!
